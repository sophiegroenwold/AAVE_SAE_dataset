# AAVE/SAE Paired Dataset

This repository contains the SAE samples accompanying the paper [Investigating African-American Vernacular English in Transformer-Based Text Generation (EMNLP 2020)](https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/2020.emnlp-main.473/).

To encourage future work in developing NLP for diverse audiences, we introduce a dataset of 2019 intent-equivalent AAVE/SAE pairs. The AAVE samples are sampled from Blodgett et. al. (2016)'s [TwitterAAE](http://slanglab.cs.umass.edu/TwitterAAE/), with their corresponding SAE samples annotated by Amazon MTurk. 

To comply with Twitter's [Terms of Service](https://developer.twitter.com/en/developer-terms/agreement-and-policy), we are only including the SAE samples here. Please reach out to us at any of the following emails for the AAVE samples:

- [lilyou@ucsb.edu](lilyou@ucsb.edu)
- [aeshaparekh@ucsb.edu](aeshaparekh@ucsb.edu)
